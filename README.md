# Fuck a Paywall

A Chrome extension that redirects any webpage to its archive.today version, bypassing paywalls with one click.

## What it does

Click the extension button on any article, and it'll redirect you to the archived version on archive.today; no more subscription prompts or article limits.

## Installation

1. Download this extension to your computer
2. Open Chrome
3. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right)
5. Click "Load unpacked"
6. Select the downloaded folder
7. You're ready to go!

(I'm too cheap to pay the developer fee for Chrome)
